# JsonIpV6
Scenario Outline: Equals for json element backed value as a ipV6
	Given the JsonElement backed JsonIpV6 <jsonValue>
	When I compare it to the ipV6 <value>
	Then the result should be <result>

	Examples:
		| jsonValue                  | value                      | result |
		| "0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:0001" | "0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:0001" | true   |
