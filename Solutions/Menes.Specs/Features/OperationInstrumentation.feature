Feature: OperationInstrumentation
	In order to monitor service usage and performance
	As a developer
	I want operation execution to be reported automatically through the instrumentation API

Background:
    Given the operation locator maps the operation id 'TestOperationId' to an operation named 'TestOperation'

Scenario: Operation started
	When I handle a 'POST' to '/test/path' with an operation id of 'TestOperationId'
    And the operation invoker has been invoked
	Then instrumentation should start a request named 'TestOperation'
    And instrumentation should have already reported the request by the time the operation implementation is invoked
    And the operation instrumentation should report an OpenAPI operation id of 'TestOperationId'
    And the request should not have been finished yet

Scenario: Operation succeeded
	When I handle a 'POST' to '/test/path' with an operation id of 'TestOperationId'
    And the operation invoker has been invoked
    And the operation completes
	Then instrumentation should start a request named 'TestOperation'
    And the request should have been finished
